/**
 * A store key might be :
 *    Number primitive value, String primitive value, Date object, or Array object.
 *    An Array is only a valid key if every item in the array is defined and is a valid key
 *
 * The object store can derive the key from one of three sources :
 *    A key generator. A key generator generates a monotonically increasing numbers every time a key is needed.
 *    Keys can be derived via a key path.
 *    Keys can also be explicitly specified when a value is stored in the object store.
 *
 * A store value might be :
 *    simple types such as String primitive values and Date objects as well as Object,
 *    Array instances, File objects, Blob objects, ImageData objects, and so on
 *
 *
 * Tx is committed when :
 *
 *    - request success callback returns
 *         - that means that multiple requests can be executed within transaction boundaries only when next request is executed from success callback of the previous one
 *    - when your task returns to event loop
 *
 * It means that if no requests are submitted to it, it is not committed until it returns to event loop.
 *
 * These facts pose 2 problematic states :
 *
 *    - enqueuing a new IDB request to event loop from within the success callback of previous request instead of submitting new request synchronously
 *        - in that case the first success callback immediately returns but another IDB request has been scheduled
 *            - ??? are all the asynchronous requests executed within the single initial tx ???
 *
 *
 *    - creating a ReadWrite tx, not placing any requests against it and creating another one before returning to event loop
 *        - ??? does creating a new one implicitly commits the previous tx?  If not, serious write lock starvations might occur, right ???
